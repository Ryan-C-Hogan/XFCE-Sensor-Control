# XFCE-Sensor-Control
A simple Python script to make up for the Xfce desktop enviroment lacking innate tilt controlling.

Written specifically for a Lenovo Yoga 920 running Ubuntu, but in theory should work for most other linux-compatable tablets and linux distributions that can use iio-sensor-proxy, xinput, and xrandr. If you use this script on a different tablet and it works please contact me at ryancharleshogan@gmail.com and I'll add it to the list.

Automatic brightness controls are planned as well.

Utilizes iio-sensor-proxy, xinput, and xrandr.
